# SalesProphet: Time Series Forecasting for Store Sales

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Store Sales Forecasting project! In this project, I'll be working with data from Corporaci√≥n Favorita, a large grocery retailer in Ecuador. The goal is to predict the sales of various product families in different Favorita stores using time-series forecasting techniques.


## Mission

The mission in this project is to build a model that can accurately predict the sales of different product families at Favorita stores. By doing so, the aim is to help the grocery retailer optimize their inventory management, reduce food waste, and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Why is This Important?

Think about how challenging it is for a grocery store to manage their inventory. If a store overstocks, they might end up with perishable goods that go to waste. On the other hand, underestimating demand can lead to popular items running out, disappointing customers, and lost revenue. Accurate forecasting is crucial to strike the right balance.
## What's in the Data?

The data includes information about:

  *  **Stores:** Each store's location, type, and cluster.
  *  **Products:** Different types of products (product families) sold.
  *  **Sales:** Historical sales data for each product family at each store.
  *  **Promotions:** Whether a product family was being promoted at a store.
  *  **Oil Prices:** Daily oil prices, which can influence economic conditions.
  *  **Holidays and Events:** Information about holidays and special events.

## How Success Will Be Measured

To evaluate the model's performance, I'll use a metric called the Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE). This metric helps us understand how well predictions align with the actual sales values.
## Potential Impact

By building an accurate sales forecasting model, I contribute to reducing food waste, improving inventory management, and ultimately enhancing the shopping experience for customers. The insights gained from this project can have a real-world impact on the operations of brick-and-mortar grocery stores.
Next Steps

Let's create a model that empowers grocery stores to make more informed decisions about their inventory and sales strategies.
